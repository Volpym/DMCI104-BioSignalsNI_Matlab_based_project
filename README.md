# Setup

Open a terminal, navigate to the project root, and create two directories:  
- `datasets`: to store the datasets used for analysis  
- `images`: to store the plots generated by the analysis  

# Sync Dependencies

This project uses `uv` to manage libraries and `venv`. If `uv` is not installed on your machine, run:  

```bash
pip install uv
```

Then create the virtual environment and sync dependencies with:

```
uv sync
```

### Important Note:

For Exercise A4, the `jadeR.m` file is required. Make sure the MATLAB Engine for Python is installed and configured. Follow the instructions here:  
[MATLAB Engine for Python Installation](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html)

# Copy Datasets

Place the dataset you will use into the respective `datasets` folder.

# Notebooks

The notebooks translate MATLAB logic from the scripts shared in class into Python:

- `A1_A2_eeg_data`: Exercises A1 and A2, using the same datasets but generating different plots
    
- `A4`: Exercise A4
